# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

# We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

# Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

# A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
