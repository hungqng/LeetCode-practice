# 463. Island Perimeter

# You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

# The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
