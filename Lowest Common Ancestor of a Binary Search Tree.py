# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        cur = root
        
        while cur:
            if p.val > cur.val and q.val > cur.val:
                cur = cur.right
            elif p.val < cur.val and q.val < cur.val:
                cur = cur.left
            else:
